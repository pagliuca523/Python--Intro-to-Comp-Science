-- git status == status about the current repository
-- git clone == local copy of the remote repository to your local Rep.
-- git add == Add a file from workspace into stage space, then the file will be marked to be committed
-- git commit -m == Now, file which is marked staged, will be added to the local repository // -m option , add an commit message with the command
-- git commit -a == The git will stage the file (add) and commit then all in a once command. (Good for known files in the local rep)
-- git push == Take the file from local rep. and add into the remote rep.


Workflow to Getting files from Git into Workspace

-- git fetch == Get file from the remote rep. into the local rep. for now, you are not be able to see the files in a workplace directory
-- git pull == get file from remote rep. into the worskpace directory (be careful) // You cant compare files before getting into working directory
-- git diff head == Show the difference between the files (local rep x worskpace)
-- git diff == Show the difference between the files (worskpace x index) // Good to see further commits before getting into index stage
-- git merge == Get file from local rep into workspace, straight away
